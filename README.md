# High Level Design Deep Dive

> A practical repository to **learn, discuss, and master High Level Design (HLD) in detail**.

## What This Repo Is About

This project is focused on **end-to-end High Level System Design discussions**.

We break down architectures from fundamentals to production-grade patterns, including:

- problem framing
- architecture evolution
- design trade-offs
- reliability and scalability strategies
- interview-ready narratives

## Core Goal

We are going to discuss **all High Level Designs in detail** with real-world thinking:

- from **Monolith to Microservices**
- from **basic API design to distributed systems**
- from **single-region deployments to multi-region resilience**

## Current Content

- `architects/summary.md` - consolidated architecture summary with diagrams
- `architects/interview-ready.md` - interview-focused architecture narrative
- `architects/Monolith/content.md` - section workspace for monolith-focused deep dives
- `architects/images/` - localized diagrams used by the docs

## Topics Covered (and expanding)

- Monolith Architecture
- Microservices Architecture
- Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
- Layered Architecture
- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Saga Pattern
- Outbox Pattern
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Cell-Based Architecture
- Active-Active and Active-Passive design
- Observability-Driven Architecture
- Scalability, Availability, Reliability, Fault Tolerance

## Why Follow This Repository

- Structured from beginner clarity to senior-level depth
- Interview-ready explanation style (FAANG/MAANG/system design rounds)
- Diagram-backed content
- Practical trade-offs over theory-only notes

- API gateway and service mesh patterns
- caching and data partitioning strategies
- consistency models and failure handling playbooks
- design review checklists and interview question sets

## Contributing

If you want a specific architecture topic added, open an issue with:

1. the use case
2. expected scale (QPS/TPS)
3. constraints (latency, consistency, region, budget)
